# Learning-Python
These are some projects or coding follow alongs that I have worked on while learning python and the Keras API.

The connect 4 game was a code follow along, but I changed the method of checking for wins so that there wouldn't be a need to check the entire board ever single time. 
Currently I am also working on adding different screens and more levels so that you can play with the computer or with another player.  

The RNN project was a follow along where I experimented with different types of normilzation for the data. 
The simple dataset was also a follow along when I was first learning how keras works. 

The VGG project was one I worked through. I had to learn how VGG worked so there was a guide code that used a different dataset, but I changed it to fit the FashionMNIST dataset.
